# VoidTallica's Primavera Code Challenge API

## .NET Core 5 Web API Project
This is a simple REST API that allows to manage costumers and sales items. This leverages .NET 5, and follows the Repository Pattern in MVC.
The data of this API is stored in a SQL Server database.

I used Entity Framework Core as a mapper and Raw SQL queries.
