# VoidTallica's Primavera Code Challenge API

## .NET Core 5 Web API Project
This is a simple REST API that allows to manage costumers and sales items. This leverages .NET 5, and follows the Repository Pattern in MVC.
The data of this API is stored in a SQL Server database.

I used Entity Framework Core to create the DBContext and Raw SQL queries.

In this project we can do the basic management of a Costumer, SalesUnit and SalesItem entities.

Upgrades: I also wanted to implent user authentication on the API and upload files to the database and in the BackEnd itself (Resources folder).
